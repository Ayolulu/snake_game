Snake Game - Classic Arcade Fun
Overview
This is a modern implementation of the classic Snake game, built using Python and the Turtle graphics library. The game features smooth animations, interactive controls, and a scoreboard that tracks the highest score achieved. I created this project to practice my Python programming skills, applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and enhancing my knowledge of GUI development.

Features
Dynamic Gameplay: The snake grows longer as it consumes food, increasing the challenge.
Custom Controls: Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement.
Score Tracking: Keeps track of the current score and maintains a high score across sessions.
Responsive Design: Smooth animations and game logic ensure a great user experience.
Customizable Elements: Features such as snake color, background, and food shape can be easily modified.
Tools and Technologies
Python
Turtle Graphics for GUI
OOP principles for modular code
File handling for high score persistence
How It Works
Snake Movement: The snake moves continuously, and the player controls its direction using arrow keys.
Food Consumption: When the snake "eats" the food, it grows longer, and the score increases.
Collision Detection:
Walls: The game resets if the snake hits the boundaries of the game area.
Self-Collision: The game resets if the snake collides with its own body.
Scoreboard: The current score and high score are displayed and updated dynamically.
Why I Built This
I developed this game to practice Python programming, apply OOP concepts, and create a fun and engaging project I could share with others.
